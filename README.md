# ECS189-Final-Project

We use this project to get familiar with github collaboration. Here's several rules that we want to obey:

1. An issue with clear description should be added for any plan of distributing tasks, adding codes, fixing bugs, etc. It should be assigned to a specific person. Once it is completed, the person who open it should close it.

2. Everyone works on his/her own branch, and creates a pull request to master when codes are finished. The person who creates the pull request should request reviews from all remaining contributors, and is reponsible for merging codes, adding explanation message, and closing pull request after all reviewers are OK with the pull request.

3. Each commit and merge operation for code files should have a short explanation message ending with the corresponding issue number. For example, "Commit message.(#1)".
